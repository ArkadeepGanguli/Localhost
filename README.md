## 📌 Problem Statement  
The **PM Internship Scheme** receives thousands of applications from youth across India, including rural areas, tribal districts, urban slums, and remote colleges. Many of these applicants are first-generation learners with limited digital exposure and no prior internship experience.  
With hundreds of internships listed on the portal, it becomes difficult for such candidates to identify opportunities that best match their skills.
